Linear Regression on Iris Dataset
A simple yet insightful implementation of linear regression using the classic Iris flower dataset. This project demonstrates how regression techniques can be applied to predict continuous features like petal length or sepal width based on other botanical measurements.
📦 Overview
- 📊 Dataset: Iris flower dataset (150 samples, 3 species)
- 🔍 Goal: Predict one continuous feature (e.g., petal length) using others (e.g., sepal length, sepal width)
- 🧮 Model: Linear Regression using scikit-learn
- 📈 Evaluation: Mean Squared Error, R² Score, Residual Analysis
- 📉 Visualization: Regression line plots, scatter plots, residual distribution
🧠 Why Linear Regression on Iris?
While the Iris dataset is often used for classification, this project explores its potential for regression tasks—ideal for understanding relationships between flower dimensions and practicing continuous prediction techniques.

Learning Objectives
- Understand linear regression fundamentals
